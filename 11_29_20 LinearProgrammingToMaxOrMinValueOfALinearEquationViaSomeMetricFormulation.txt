first install libaries in anaconda prompt
pulp, scipy, glpk, pandas, seaborn: 


pip install pandas

cls

python -m pip install -U "scipy==1.4.*" "pulp==2.1"


$ pulptest
$ conda install -c conda-forge glpk

open Jupiter notebook & name it LinearProgramming
	by changing e.g. "UNTITLED4" to LinearProgSample at the top

- goto computer search box at bottom & search for
	LinearProgSample

-  then on bottom right click: 
	e.g. Location  C:\Users\KOROPEYB (takes you to location)

- double click on ANACONDA3 folder - LIB - 


- CMD in search to open Windows Command prompt
	
tar -xvzf C:\Users\KOROPEYB\Downloads\PuLP-2.3.1.tar.gz -C C:\Users\KOROPEYB\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages

tar -xvzf C:\Users\KOROPEYB\Downloads\glpk-0.4.6.tar.gz -C C:\Users\KOROPEYB\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages

tar -xvzf C:\Users\KOROPEYB\Downloads\scipy-1.5.4.tar.gz -C C:\Users\KOROPEYB\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages

- so now that have libraries imported into LIB folder
	in the ANACONDA3 folder on desktop

	so run jupiter notebook to see if runs


from pulp import LpMaximize, LpProblem, LpStatus,
     LpSum, LpVariable


- Search & open Anaconda Prompt:

	python -m venv linprog
	
	linprog\Scripts\activate

for LinearProgramming sample problem to Maximize or Minimize the target 
valueof a Linear Equation via a Metric Formulation, we do following:

https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/


open JupiterNotebook - New - Python3

from pulp import LpMaximize, LpProblem, LpStatus, lpSum, LpVariable

# Define the model
model = LpProblem(name="resource-allocation", sense=LpMaximize)

# Define the decision variables
x = {i: LpVariable(name=f"x{i}", lowBound=0) for i in range(1, 5)}

# Add constraints
model += (lpSum(x.values()) <= 50, "manpower")
model += (3 * x[1] + 2 * x[2] + x[3] <= 100, "material_a")
model += (x[2] + 2 * x[3] + 3 * x[4] <= 90, "material_b")

# Set the objective
model += 20 * x[1] + 12 * x[2] + 40 * x[3] + 25 * x[4]

# Solve the optimization problem
status = model.solve()


# Get the results
print(f"status: {model.status}, {LpStatus[model.status]}")
print(f"objective: {model.objective.value()}")

for var in x.values():
    print(f"{var.name}: {var.value()}")

for name, constraint in model.constraints.items():
    print(f"{name}: {constraint.value()}")

SINCE THE ABOVE DOESN'T WORK, Instead Use SciPy BELOW:

from scipy.optimize import linprog

obj = [-20, -12, -40, -25]

lhs_ineq = [[1, 1, 1, 1],  # Manpower
            [3, 2, 1, 0],  # Material A
            [0, 1, 2, 3]]  # Material B

rhs_ineq = [ 50,  # Manpower
            100,  # Material A
             90]  # Material B

opt = linprog(c=obj, A_ub=lhs_ineq, b_ub=rhs_ineq,
              method="revised simplex")
print(opt)


# WHEN RUN GET THE FOLLOWING RESULTS:

 con: array([], dtype=float64)				# we want to maximize the profit by determining how many units of each product to manufacture given constraints limited manpower can only produce up to 50 units or products per day, 100 units of RawMaterialA, 90 units of RawMaterialB, and 4th constraint number of units of each product (x1, x2, x3, x4) each >= zero 
     fun: -1900.0					# max profit is $1900 which get by producing 5 units of first product and 45 units of the third product
 message: 'Optimization terminated successfully.'
     nit: 2						# no. of iterations it had to go through to come up with solution
   slack: array([ 0., 40.,  0.])			# slack is how much more room you have, e.g. 100 units of RawMatA on-hand but consume 60 so 40 remaining,  0 (zero) is the first constraint (manpower of 50 units produced) so no remainder all 50 units produced, and last zero(0) is the 3rd constraint of materialB or all 90 units used to Achieve optimal profit.  NOTE SolverExcel doesn't give you slack output value
  status: 0						# integer between zero (0) to four (4) given 5 possible outcomes of this question (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 = 5) zero means the Optimal solution was found.    Status 3 = problem appears unbounded no restrictions to the solutions because contraints are too loose.						
 success: True						# 
       x: array([ 5.,  0., 45.,  0.])			# x is no. of units of each product individually to be produced (5 units of product 1, 0 units of product 2, 45 units of product 3 and 0 units of product 4)


# goto https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/
# and scroll down to "Resource Allocation" to understand problem


Steps:

1) define your variables (e.g. 4 variables, x1, x2, x3, x4);

* ARE THESE VARIABLES RELATED TO SOME TOTAL COST OR PROFIT
  OR REVENUES OF INTEREST?

* THEN WHAT IS DATA FOR THESE VARIABLES (TOTAL COST, PROFIT, REV)
  FOR THE SAME PERIOD 2017-2021?


2) write your constraint as equations (or inequalities) in-terms
	of the variables above;
		e.g. x1+x2+x3+x4 <= 50
3) write the objective Function (to maximize or minimize some expressions)
		e.g. Profit = 20x1 + 12x2 + 40x3 + 25x4 
			Objective is to Maximize Profit

4) code the system of equations or inequalities using the approach above 
	where we extract the coeffients of the Left Hand side inequaltiy 
		(e.g. [1,1,1,1] from x1+x2+x3+x4 <= 50
		and the 
	Right Hand side inequality (e.g. 50, 100, 90 = right hand side of the contraint)
			[50,100,90]


	from scipy.optimize import linprog
	obj = [-20, -12, -40, -25]
	lhs_ineq = [[1, 1, 1, 1],  # Manpower
	            [3, 2, 1, 0],  # Material A
        	    [0, 1, 2, 3]]  # Material B

	rhs_ineq = [ 50,  # Manpower
	            100,  # Material A
        	     90]  # Material B
	opt = linprog(c=obj, A_ub=lhs_ineq, b_ub=rhs_ineq,
              method="revised simplex")
	print(opt)


5) print out of solution

6) save jypiterNotebook file:
	e.g. goto to top UNTITLED4 and change to 12-6-20LinearRegression
	see openfile lower left and click on its ... (3 dots on its right)
		and then click on ShowInFolder from drop-down
		and then rightClickCopy or send
