Some books referenced during this week's Rutger's Rate Eng seminar (check my spelling):

	Bob Wilson - Non Linear Pricing

	Rone Cose - contraversial of non linear costs

	Ralph Turvy "6 part tariff"
		non coincident demand
		coincident demand
		fixed charge


	"Multi Part PRicing"

	"Subscription Pricing"
		tested by SCE many years ago
		currently used in Holland

	Cost & Causation are basic principles


	

	a rate that recognizes that capacity & energy
	are 2 different services 
		fixed charge

		energy charge

		time of use (demand charge)

	1. use short run Marginal Cost pricing where you can
	2. layer-in long-run marginal cost 
		(shared system costs can be done on a time
		varying basis)
			its the time of system stress which
			is important
	3. Price on system Flows
	
	The Temperature of the heating oil on transformer
	is closely related to demand (for proxy)
