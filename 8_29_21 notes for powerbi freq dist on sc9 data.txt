once pull SC9 tables into powerbi

given 25 bins of 0-1, 1-2,...,24-25, then 

- then RIGHT CLICK on BILLED DEMAND 
- Group Type: BIN - Bin Type: Number of BINS 
- Bin Count: 25 
- click OK

Then Notice below Billed Demand filed is a new
+BILLED DEMAND box - and check its box for e.g. +Billed Demand
- Then goto VISUALIZATIONS - click Clustered Column Chart
- Then drag e.g. +BILLED DEMAND(bins) into AXIS field
- WHILE also drag e.g. +BILLED DEMAND into VALUES field
	- then in VALUES Billed Demand dropDown to COUNT DISTINCT	

- THen to Right of Axis click FORMAT (rollerBrushIcon)
	then under Xaxis under Type change to Categorical (from continuous)

	

--- so we see from above that about 5,103 customers
	in SC9 fall into 0-1 bucket 


--- then to writeOut to excel do following:
	- Publish
	- Save As only allows to save as PDF export (paid version allows for export to excel)

9/6/21 - MATCH functions using powerBI using SC9
		e.g. sum the GT Demand HT LT, 
		Primary Demand  HT LT 
		& Peak ON Off Peak


- goto TABLE on left side 
- click on NEW COlUMN - click into its formula Bar for New Column
	- Column = GT_DEMAND_LT + GT_DEMAND_HT
		- right click in Column & Rename to GT_DEMAND_LTHT
		- click ApplyChanges
	
	- Repeat for other columns to add or any operation


If however wanted to Group the fields by new criteria then
would use GROUP BY functions as follows:

	- Transform Data functions for 
	- then select GROUPBY on top right side 
	- select GROUP BY - Basic

	- e.g. select CYCLE MONTH
	- New Column Name: SumOfOnPeakKWHLT
	- Operation: SUM
	- Column: ON_PEAK_KWH_LT
	- OK
	- Close & Apply
	
	-
