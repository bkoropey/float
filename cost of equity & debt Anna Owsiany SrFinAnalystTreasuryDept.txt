    sorry to torture you with this.  You were kind enough to take my questions.  We had a much higher wacc at Duke Energy so it makes me think.

    do you remember when you ran the analysis at Duke?
​[2:37 PM] Owsiany, Anna E.
    My guess would be the expected market return could impact your valuation, because I don't think there is a "standard" number to use for that.
​[2:39 PM] Owsiany, Anna E.
    if you need me to pull any other data points, just reach out

    October.  The numbers they gave were given as "standard assumptions" from the treasury department so as to leave no room for interpretation.  
​[2:42 PM] Koropey, Boris
    and you would not add in the commercial paper rate as part of the cost of debt?
​[2:43 PM] Owsiany, Anna E.
    I calculated cost short-term debt separately from long-term debt

    that would be great.  I will use these values of 3.14% wacc on 12/31/2020 and 3.74% as of 3/5/21.
​[2:44 PM] Owsiany, Anna E.
    short-term debt added only 1bps to the WACC in Q3
​[2:44 PM] Owsiany, Anna E.
    IF you want feel free to reach out to Dave Blessing, my manager, to see if he has a different view on WACC
​[2:47 PM] Koropey, Boris
    if you think that would be okay then I will do that as well.  I really appreciate your assistance and will likely have questions in the future.  Thank you again, Anna.
​[2:48 PM] Owsiany, Anna E.
    definitely, better to get more inputs than less.
