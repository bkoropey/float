Using principal component analysis:

We want to predict the Merchant Function Charge per kWh (dependent variable)
with the MAC, MSCI, MSCII and electric supply charge MSC are our independent variables


5 iterations of assigning difference dependent variables all the while
keeping MFC, MAC, MSCI, MSCII and SupplyCHarge MSC as independent variables:

1) MFC
2) MAC
3) MSCI
4) MSCII
5) SupplyCharge MSC
